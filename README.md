Random is a random number generator that can randomly pick from a list, written in Vala.
## Uses
- Choose what to do for a date
- Play a number-guess game
- Choose between coffee or tea
- Pick what to greet your step-aunt with
- (bad idea) Choose if you want to sacrifice yourself to Ba'al the soul eater
- Anything
## Building
Use GNOME Builder to build this. If you don't want it in Flatpak, you can figure that out.
## Downloading and using
Download it from Flathub by clicking the really big button above, or head on over to the [Releases](https://codeberg.org/foreverxml/random/releases) page and grab the latest Flatpak, then install it.
### Windows
I don't support anything but Flatpak. You will have to run this app through WSL, although Windows is such a privacy nightmare I do not support WSL. The app may be broken on Windows too. My reccomendation is to use this app on GNOME *NIX systems.
## Translations
Help me make some po files! I'm not very fluent in any language except English, so translations would be appreciated. Do NOT include .mo files, I will reject your PR if so.

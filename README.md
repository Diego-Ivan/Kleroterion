# Random
![icon for Random](https://codeberg.org/foreverxml/random/raw/branch/hig/data/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/page.codeberg.foreverxml.Random.svg)   
Random is a random number generator that can randomly pick from a list, written in Vala.
## Uses
- Choose what to do for a date
- Play a number-guess game
- Choose between coffee or tea
- Pick what to greet your step-aunt with
- (bad idea) Choose if you want to sacrifice yourself to Ba'al the soul eater
- Anything
## Building
Use GNOME Builder to build this. Else, you can use `flatpak-builder` or `meson` and `ninja`.
## Downloading and using
Head on over to the [Releases](https://codeberg.org/foreverxml/random/releases) page and grab the latest Flatpak, then install it.
## What about the "random" CLI tool?
I know about it, and the executable is the same name. That is why this app will ONLY be distributed as a Flatpak until further notice, and until it is fixed to `randomgtk` instead of `random`.

## Building
Use GNOME Builder >= 3.28 to build this. If you don't want it in Flatpak, you can figure that out.
## Downloading & using
Download it from Flathub by clicking the really big button above, or head on over to the [Releases](https://codeberg.org/foreverxml/random/releases) page and grab the latest Flatpak, then install it.
### Windows
I don't support anything but Flatpak. You will have to run this app through WSL, although Windows is such a privacy nightmare I do not support WSL. The app may be broken on Windows too. My reccomendation is to use this app on GNOME *NIX systems.
## Translations
Help me make some po files! I'm not very fluent in any language except English, so translations would be appreciated. Do NOT include .mo files, I will reject your PR if so.

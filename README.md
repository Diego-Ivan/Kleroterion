## Techy stuff
<details>
<summary>Show the techy stuff</summary>

## Building
Use GNOME Builder >= 3.28 to build this. If you don't want it in Flatpak, you can figure that out.
## A note for downloading & using
You can get it through the user-submitted AUR repo, but that will usually be out of date. The method I support the most is Flathub/Flatpak.
### Windows
I don't support anything but Flatpak. You will have to run this app through WSL, although Windows is such a privacy nightmare I do not support WSL. The app may be broken on Windows too. My reccomendation is to use this app on GNOME *NIX systems.
## Translations
Help me make some po files! I'm not very fluent in any language except English, so translations would be appreciated. Do NOT include .mo files, I will reject your PR if so.

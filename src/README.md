# ⚙️ The Source Folder
Everything techincal happens here! The UI and functionality... it's all here.
## 👩‍💻️ Contributing
It's rather simple. You just:

- Update the file
- Test if it works
- Update the POT file (and maybe some PO files too)
- Make a PR!

And THAT is how you contribute to the source folder.

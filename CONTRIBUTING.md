Hey there! So, you want to contribute to Random.
- First thing to do, mention that you're contributing (if you don't make an issue or PR) to my email. I'll add you.
- Next, here are some things I will label as wontfix.
    - Anything against GNOME HIG
    - Something too advanced for this simple app
And don't forget to test before your PR! Have a great day.

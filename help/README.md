## How to pick a number
Random will launch in the *Number* view, denoted by a keypad in the view switcher. To generate a number, you need to have a range of numbers; for this example, that range is from 15 to 30. You put your lower number in the **first box** and the higher number in the **second box**. For our exaple, 15 goes in the first box and 30 goes into the second. Then, click the *Generate* button to generate a number, or press `Ctrl` + `G` on your keyboard. You can see how it's done below:

## How to pick an item in Roulette
You will have to [switch views](#switching-between-the-views) to use the *Roulette* view. To roll the *Roulette* wheel, you have to have a list, and a separator. Let's consider the list `A, B, C, D`. That list would be the list, and the separator would be `, ` with that extra space. Paste or write your list in the long box, and in the short box write in your separator. Then, click the *Pick* button, or press `Ctrl` + `G` to spin the *Roulette* wheel. You can see how it's done below:

### Why the separator?
Due to how *Random* works, you need a separator to separate the contents of the list. *Random* cannot automatically detect your separator.

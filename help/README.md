## How to pick a number
Random will launch in the *Number* view, denoted by a keypad in the view switcher. To generate a number, you need to have a range of numbers; for this example, that range is from 15 to 30. You put your lower number in the **top box** and the higher number in the **bottom box**. For our exaple, 15 goes in the first box and 30 goes into the second. Then, click the *Generate* button to generate a number, or press `Ctrl` + `G` on your keyboard. You can see how it's done below (click on the image for a moving version):

## How to pick an item in Roulette
You will have to [switch views](#switching-between-the-views) to use the *Roulette* view. To roll the *Roulette* wheel, you have to have a list seperated by a forward slash (a forward slash is /) If you wanted to pick between *Layla, Rose, Cleveland,* and *Lampy*, you would write `Layla/Rose/Cleveland/Lampy`. Now, put that list in the text box. Then, click the *Pick* button, or press `Ctrl` + `G` to spin the *Roulette* wheel. You can see how it's done below (click on the image for a moving version):

## Converting from Number to Roulette
In *Random* you can convert your *Number* generation to a *Roulette* list. First, you open the *Random* app main menu, which you can do by clicking it or pressing `F10`, and selecting *Number to Roulette*. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`. It will first switch to the *Number* view, so you can enter your number range as shown in the *[Number](#how-to-pick-a-number)* help sheet. Then, you press the button or shortcut again, and it will convert your range of numbers to a *Roulette* list you can use in *Roulette*. You can see how it's done below (click on the image for a moving version):

## Spinning and removing in Roulette
You can spin the *Roulette* wheel and delete the spun item in *Random*. To do it, follow the *[Roulette](#how-to-pick-an-item-in-roulette)* help sheet, but don't click the *Spin* button. Instead, open the *Random* app main menu by clicking the menu button or pressing `F10`. Then, select *Delete Picked Item*, or `Ctrl` + `D` and it will spin the Roulette wheel. You can see how it's done below (click on the image for a moving version):
